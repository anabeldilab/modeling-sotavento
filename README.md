# modeling-sotavento
Study, analysis and modeling of a photovoltaic solar system located in the bioclimatic home of Sotavento Galicia.


## Preprocessing
1. **Drop columns**: Drop columns that are not useful for the models. In this case, 'id' column has been dropped in most of the datasets. Densidad (Torre 12) dataset was the different one, so 'id_anemo' column was dropped instead.

2. **Study of missing data**: Plots were created to study the behavior of missing data in the datasets to choose whether it was convenient to simply discard them or make an imputation. For now, the decision was to discard them. The percentage of missing data was, for some features, 100% and for the rest of the features, less than 1% in all datasets.

3. **Discard missing data**: Missing data was discarded in all datasets. So it was decided to discard them.

4. **Normalization**: The data was normalized using the z-score normalization method. This method is used to normalize the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is done to avoid the problem of different scales in the data.

5. **Study of outliers**: The data was studied to detect outliers. The boxplot method was used to detect them.

4. **Study of the correlation between features**: The correlation between the features was studied to detect multicollinearity. The correlation matrix was calculated and a heatmap was created to visualize the correlation between the features.


## Modeling
In this section, the models were created to predict the power generated by the photovoltaic system. The models were created using the `scikit-learn` library. The models were evaluated using the `cross_validate` function from the `sklearn.model_selection` module. The metrics used to evaluate the models were `MSE`, `RMSE`, `MAE`, `MAPE`, `SMAPE` and `R2`. The models were evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation.

The following models were created:

1. **Linear Regression**: A linear regression model was created to predict the power generated by the photovoltaic system.

2. **Polynomial Regression**: A polynomial regression model was created to predict the power generated by the photovoltaic system.

3. **Random Forest Regressor**: A random forest regressor model was created to predict the power generated by the photovoltaic system.

4. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: A gradient boosting regressor model was created to predict the power generated by the photovoltaic system.

5. **XGBoost Regressor**: An XGBoost regressor model was created to predict the power generated by the photovoltaic system.

6. **Support Vector Regressor**: A support vector regressor model was created to predict the power generated by the photovoltaic system.

7. **K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor**: A k-nearest neighbors regressor model was created to predict the power generated by the photovoltaic system.
